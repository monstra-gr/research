# Monstra Research Repo
Wellcome to the Monstra Research Repository[^1]!
Here we'll getter and colaborate with the internal and external comunity to create researchs that will serve as reference for future projects or other repos. 

# Objectives
Organizations usualy struggles with:
- **No Single Source of Truth:** Research is scattered all over the place, with no central place to go.
- **Lack of Consistency:** A unified, structured, and standardized research approach is missing.
- **Disconnected Research:** Difficulty in cross-study analysis and bridging the gap between past research findings and new insights.
- **Underutilized Research:** Research reports remain unread and data gets lost.
- **Duplication:** Research is repeated multiple times.
- **Knowledge Drain:** Valuable insights are lost as researchers change jobs and their knowledge leaves with them.
